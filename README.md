# <b> Streaming Session-Based Recommendation: When Graph Neural Networks meet the Neighborhood</br> 
## <b> Streaming-Based Recommendation (SR): </br>
### SR refers to the task of finding the best recommendation for the users based on the previous recorded user interaction with the system.</br>
### <b> Streaming Session-Based Recommendation (SSR):</br>
### 1. One of the most challenging task in which the recommendation is provided based on the short term interest of the user in any live session.</br>
### 2. SSR has its application in the fields of news recommendation, e-commerce applications and social media recommendations.</br>
### 3. All SSR methods uses the class of techniques that incorporates online machine learning and incremental updates without re-training the model. </br>

## <b> Goal of the experiment:</br>
### 1. Reproducing the results of GNN method.</br>
### 2. Show the potential of simpler models such as KNN which can be used as baseline models for SSR applications.</br>
